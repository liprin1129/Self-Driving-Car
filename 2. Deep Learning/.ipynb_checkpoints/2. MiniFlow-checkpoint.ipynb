    "\n",
    "Neural networks take advantage of alternating transforms and activation functions to better categorize outputs. The sigmoid function is among the most common activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "sigmoid(x) = \\frac{1}{1+ e^{-x}} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Equation(3)}\n",

    "$$\\text{Graph of the sigmoid function. Notice the \"S\" shape.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear transforms are great for simply shifting values, but neural networks often require a more nuanced transform. For instance, one of the original designs for an artificial neuron, [the perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), exhibit binary output behavior. Perceptrons compare a weighted input to a threshold. When the weighted input exceeds the threshold, the perceptron is activated and outputs __1__, otherwise it outputs __0__.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could model a perceptron's behavior as a step function.\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures2/save-2.png\", width=400>\n",
    "$$ \\text{Example of a step function (The jump between y = 0 and y = 1 should be instantaneous).} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation, the idea of binary output behavior, generally makes sense for classification problems. For example, if you ask the network to hypothesize if a handwritten image is a '9', you're effectively asking for a binary output - yes, this is a '9', or no, this is not a '9'. A step function is the starkest form of a binary output, which is great, but step functions are not continuous and not differentiable, which is very bad. Differentiation is what makes gradient descent possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function, Equation (3) above, replaces thresholding with a beautiful S-shaped curve (also shown above) that mimics the activation behavior of a perceptron while maintaining continuity, and thus differentiability. As a bonus, the sigmoid function has a very simple derivative that looks remarkably similar to the sigmoid itself.\n",

    "\\text{Equation (4). } \\sigma \\text{ represents Equation (3)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the sigmoid function only has one parameter. Remember that sigmoid is an activation function (non-linearity), meaning it takes a single input and performs a mathematical operation on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the sigmoid function makes decisions. When given weighted features from some data, it indicates whether or not the features contribute to a classification. In that way, a sigmoid activation works well following a linear transformation. As it stands right now with random weights and bias, the sigmoid node's output is also random. The process of learning through backpropagation and gradient descent, which you will implement soon, modifies the weights and bias such that activation of the sigmoid node begins to match expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I've given you the equation for the sigmoid function, I want you to add it to the __MiniFlow__ library. To do so, you'll want to use __np.exp__ ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html)) to make your life much easier.\n",

    "You'll be using __Sigmoid__ in conjunction with __Linear__. Here's how it should look:\n",

    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a version of Gradient Descent where on each forward pass a batch of data is randomly sampled from total dataset. Remember when we talked about the batch size earlier? That's the size of the batch. Ideally, the entire dataset would be fed into the neural network on each forward pass, but in practice, it's not practical due to memory constraints. SGD is an approximation of Gradient Descent, the more batches processed by the neural network, the better the approximation.\n",

    "A naïve implementation of SGD involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly sample a batch of data from the total dataset.\n",
    "2. Running the network forward and backward to calculate the gradient (with data from (1)).\n",

    "4. Repeat steps 1-3 until convergence or the loop is stopped by another mechanism (i.e. the number of epochs).\n",
