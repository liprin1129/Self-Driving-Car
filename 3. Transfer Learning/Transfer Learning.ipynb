    "__Transfer learning__ is the practice of starting with a network that has already been trained, and then applying that network to your own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because neural networks can often take days or even weeks to train, transfer learning (i.e. starting with a network that somebody else has already trained) can greatly shorten training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we apply transfer learning? Two popular methods are __feature extraction__ and __finetuning__.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Feature extraction__. Take a pretrained neural network and replace the final (classification) layer with a new classification layer, or perhaps even a small feedforward network that ends with a new classification layer. During training the weights in all the pre-trained layers are frozen, so only the weights for the new layer(s) are trained. In other words, the gradient doesn't flow backwards past the first new layer.\n",
    "2. __Finetuning__. This is similar to feature extraction except the pre-trained weights aren't frozen. The network is trained end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labs in this lesson will focus on feature extraction since it's less computationally intensive."

    "In this lab, we will continue exploring transfer learning. We've already explored feature extraction with AlexNet and TensorFlow. Next, we will use Keras to explore feature extraction with the VGG, Inception and ResNet architectures. The models we will use were trained for days or weeks on the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/). Thus, the weights encapsulate higher-level features learned from training on thousands of classes.\n",

    "2. Bottleneck Features. Unless you have a very powerful GPU, running feature extraction on these models will take a significant amount of time, as you might have observed in the AlexNet lab. To make things easier we've precomputed bottleneck features for each (network, dataset) pair. This will allow us to experiment with feature extraction even on a modest CPU. We can think of bottleneck features as feature extraction but with caching. Because the base network weights are frozen during feature extraction, the output for an image will always be the same. Thus, once the image has already been passed through the network, we can cache and reuse the output.\n",
    "3. Furthermore, we've limited each class in both training datasets to 100 examples. The idea here is to push feature extraction a bit further. It also greatly reduces the download size and speeds up training. The validation files remain the same.\n",
